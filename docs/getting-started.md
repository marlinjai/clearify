# Getting Started

## Installation

Install Clearify as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install clearify --save-dev
```

## Create your first docs

Create a `docs/` folder in your project root and add an `index.md`:

```markdown
# My Project

Welcome to my project documentation!
```

## Start the dev server

```bash
npx clearify dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4747` to see your docs.
